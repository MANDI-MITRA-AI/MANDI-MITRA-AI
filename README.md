🎯 The Problem
Street food vendors are the backbone of India's vibrant culinary culture. However, they often operate on thin margins and face daily challenges in managing their finances. A significant, often overlooked, aspect is the daily procurement of raw materials from local markets (mandis). Lacking easy-to-use tools, they struggle with:

Manual Tracking: Inconsistent or non-existent records of daily expenses.
No Financial Insight: Difficulty in understanding spending patterns, identifying price fluctuations, or calculating profitability.
Inefficient Purchasing: Making purchasing decisions based on gut feeling rather than data, leading to potential losses.
✨ The Solution: Mandi Mitra AI
Mandi Mitra AI (meaning Market Friend AI) is a hyper-focused, mobile-first web application designed to be the digital companion for these vendors. It replaces manual guesswork with a simple, intuitive interface for logging purchases and an AI assistant that provides actionable insights.

Our goal is to empower vendors to make smarter purchasing decisions, track their expenses effortlessly, and ultimately increase their profitability, all through a tool that is accessible and easy to use.
